This is the full listing of civics with descriptions.

[b]Origins[/b]

[list]
[*][i]Galactic Backdoor (Any)[/i] - This civilization has a wormhole in their home system - potential boon to exploration, or an invitation to invasion? (Start with a wormhole in your home system. The Wormhole Stabilization tech option starts ready to research. Warning: There are fewer limits on where the wormhole's exit point can spawn than normal. This origin may lead to some interesting interactions.)

[*][i]Shroud-Touched (Not Materialist)[/i] - The Otherworld has left its mark on this civilization's homeworld and its people. They are naturally in tune with psychic energies. (Most pops of your starting species have the Natural Esper trait, which is a lesser psionic trait. Can get leader traits like lesser versions of psionic leader traits. Very rarely, actual Latent Psionics can spawn. The Psionic Theory tech option starts ready to research. Your homeworld has an Otherworld Pockets deposit which adds special esper jobs.)

[*][i]For Discovery (Materialist)[/i] - This civilization established early contact and intellectual collaboration with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding a common interest in scientific advancement, they decided to enter a more formal arrangement for sharing the fruits of their intellectual efforts. (Start as the leader of a Research Cooperative federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with The Federation tradition unlocked.)

[*][i]Diplomatic Directive: Discover (Machine Intelligence)[/i] - This machine intelligence established early contact and intellectual collaboration with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding a common interest in scientific advancement, they decided to enter a more formal arrangement for sharing the fruits of their intellectual efforts. (Start as the leader of a Research Cooperative federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with the Universal Compatibility tradition unlocked.)

[*][i]Tradeways (Merchant Guilds)[/i] - This civilization established early contact and exchange with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding that they shared an interest in their mutual material enrichment, they decided to enter an interstellar trade compact to enjoy that diverse fruits of their industry. (Start as the leader of a Trade League federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with The Federation tradition unlocked.)

[*][i]Tradeways, Inc. (Megacorporation)[/i] - This global megacorporation established early contact and exchange with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding that they shared an interest in their mutual material enrichment, they decided to enter an interstellar trade compact to enjoy that diverse fruits of their industry. (Same as Tradeways.)

[*][i]Grand Alliance (Militarist)[/i] - This civilization established early contact with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding each other to be strong believers in the need for military excellence in a potentially dangerous universe, they entered a defensive coalition for mutual security. And potentially joint conquest. (Start as the leader of a Martial Alliance federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with The Federation tradition unlocked.)

[*][i]Uplift (Any)[/i] - An alien empire has meddled in the development of this civilization, enlightening them to the level of technology required for interstellar travel and possibly even modifying them from pre-sapient origins. (Start as the "ward" of an advanced empire, a special vassal type with a large amount of autonomy. You will have the ability to select one of a number of unique advantages upon starting the game, including traits normally available only to pre-sapients, other species traits, or empire bonsues. Get rewards for enlightening primitives or uplifting pre-sapients.)

[*][i]Sublight Empire (Not Egalitarian)[/i] - This civilization started their efforts at interstellar colonization before even unlocking the secrets of FTL travel. Once they discovered it, they shared it with their sublight colonies with enough strings attached to keep those offshoots under their thumbs... for now. (Start as the overlord of three special vassal empires of your species, which will provide you with resources via taxes although you will not be able to integrate them. These vassals will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system and will eventually break from from your FTL monopoly. One vassal is loyal and shares your ethics, one is the result of a generation ship and will have random ethics, the third will be composed of dissidents with opposed ethics. Unique colony interaction events culminating in the evolution of the system into new forms. WARNING: This origin can only be guaranteed to work properly when choosing a base game planet type for your homeworld.)

[*][i]Sublight Commonwealth (Not Authoritarian)[/i] - This civilization started their efforts at interstellar colonization before even unlocking the secrets of FTL travel. Once they discovered it, they shared it with their sublight colonies on the condition of their entering an interstellar commonwealth of worlds that, in theory, works for the benefit of all members, but tends to give most decision-making power to the homeworld. (Start as the overlord of three special vassal empires of your species. You will not be able to integrate them, but as the respected leader of their combined efforts, you gain Influence and Unity from the arrangement. These vassals will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. One vassal is loyal and shares your ethics, one is the result of a generation ship and will have random ethics, the third will be composed of dissidents with opposed ethics. Unique colony interaction events culminating in the evolution of the system into new forms. WARNING: This origin can only be guaranteed to work properly when choosing a base game planet type for your homeworld.)
