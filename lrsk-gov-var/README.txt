GOVERNMENT VARIETY PACK
A grab bag of new civics and government types.

1. New Civics

There are 20 new civic choices, hand-crafted in a ridiculously obsessive-compulsive quest to fill unused government/ethic niches with whatever modifiers I could semi-plausibly cram in.

Elected Clergy (Democratic, Spiritualist) - In this society's religion, local priests are elected by their congregations. Doctrine is varied and open to consensus interpretation. (+25% planetary edict duration)

Ascetic Virtues (Not Materialist) - This culture's religious beliefs include strict dietary and exercise requirements which help the body as much as the mind. (+10 years to leader age, +5% growth rate)

Republicanism (Democratic) - This society believes that the greatest virtue is attained by people of good character serving the common good. (+25% leader experience gain, +2 leader pool size)

Utilitarian Planning (Dictatorship, not Spiritualist)  - The dictatorship is concerned with doing the greatest good for the greatest number by rational calculation of resource allocation. (-10% pop food requirements, -10% resettlement cost)

Grandiosity (Dictatorial) - In this society, one can't be taken seriously as a dictator without building some big military hardware. (Enables oversized stations and ships)

Universal Sovereignty (Dictatorial or Imperial, not Xenophobic) - The ruler has an inclusive ideology that embraces all forms of sentient life... as future subjects. (-10% vassal integration cost, -20% vassal integration cooldown (NOTE: No idea why the cooldown shows up red text in the tooltip, everywhere else in the game negative values for this modifier are beneficial))

Workers' Councils (Egalitarian, no Business Lobby) - Trade unions, democratic workplaces, and cooperatives are a vital part of civil society and an integral part of government. (-10% building and ship construction time)

Supremacist Demagoguery (Dictatorship or Democracy, not Xenophile and not Egalitarian) - The government manipulates the population with saber rattling rhetoric and appeals to common prejudices and fears. (+10% rivalry influence gain, +20% army morale damage)

Enlightened Liberalism (Not Spiritualist, not Fanatic Authoritarian) - This society values personal rights, individual enterprise, advancing knowledge, and technical innovation. A culture for true captains of industry. (-20% research and mining station cost)

Business Lobby (Not Democratic, no Workers' Councils) - This society's economy is dominated by entrenched business interests that benefit from lucrative kickback contracts, regulatory loopholes, and wage suppression. (+5% mineral and energy output)

Chivalry (Imperial, Militarist) - Ideals of martial valor and honorable conduct define ruling class culture. (+20% army morale, +1 military leader levels)

Lifelong Learning (Democratic or Pacifist) - This society values public education so strongly that opportunities for learning and development are made available throughout citizens' lives. (-15% scientist recruit cost, +15% survey speed)

Institutionalized Collectivism (Not Democratic, Materialist) - The regime operates by state control of industry and infrastructure. (-5% slave unhappiness, -5% ship upkeep)

Direct Revelation (Egalitarian or Pacifist, and Spiritualist) - The religious culture of this society values insights from personal experiences of the divine. (-20% expansion effect on Tradition cost)

Royal Absolutism (Imperial, Authoritarian) - The monarch is the state, whose will is law without limit. (-25% to Governing Ethics Attraction penalty due to distance)

Public Works (Any) - A system of public employment makes labor power available for many tasks. (-15% clear tile blocker cost, +5% habitability)

Imperial Economy (Dictatorial/Imperial, not Xenophile) - This empire exploits its vassals ruthlessly. (+15% subject research share, +5% tributary income)

Colonial Fiefs (Imperial, not Militarist) - The monarch is willing to grant landholding rights to those bold enough to colonize new worlds. (+15% colony development speed, -15% expansion influence cost)

Automated Indolence (Materialist) - This society, very early on in its industrial revolution, decided to deal with questions of labor and inequality by 'letting machines do the work' as much as possible and its social structure and technical focus has adapted to match. (-5% Unrest, +10% robot output)

State Secular Rationalism (Dictatorial and Materialist) - The dictatorship sees religion as a destabilizing and divisive force and discourages its practice (and/or encourages inter-religious toleration) through a variety of means. (+10% Governing ethics attraction, âˆ’10% Tradition Cost from Xeno Pops)

2. New Governments

I think there are like... I wanna say 30? Maybe even 40 at this point? Too many to list, and anyway, isn't "discovering" them from civic/authority/ethos combos half the fun? They fall into three broad categories:

First, an assortment of new government types for Spiritualists, Imperial and Dictatorial authority, and I wanna say Xenophobes and Militarists. So this is not a useful description but there's no real category for this stuff.

Second, an attempt to recapture some of that good-old collectivist/individualist flavor. Here, I made a good faith effort to include both positive and negative examples of what you might call "socialist" and "capitalist" governments. I have my own opinions, but I genuinely tried to see the best in ideas I disagree with for the positive examples and the worst in ideas I agree with for the negative ones. So please take your terminology flame wars to the dump where they belong, tia.

Third, because I am a huge French Revolution nerd, there's a series of governments related to that. It includes governments modeled on the actual forms of government that France evolved through in that period and governments based on the ideal forms various participants wanted. (Most are actually a mix of both.) MP3s of "Ca Ira" and "Le Chant du Depart" not included.

If you're *really* curious about what all the new governments are, well, I'm too damn lazy to put them all here and it would make this description obnoxiously long. So you can dig into the mod files, which (if you're new to this modding game and don't already know) should be at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\281990\901988941\lrsk-gov-var.zip, then: \localisation\lrsk_gov_var_govs_l_english.yml

If you don't want to do that, here are some hints: Most of the new governments involve my civics in some way. Many of them are about mixing what seem at first blush to be thematic opposites. Some combine new civics with existing ones in complimentary ways, but require an additional ethos choice to show up. (I'm not being coy, these are literally the only general "patterns" that I see in my designs.)

NOTE: The spiritualist faction will demand that you be running specific named government types, none of which are mod-added, obviously. These are set in the faction definition file. For reasons of compatibility, I have created a fix for this as a separate mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=912834599]here[/url].

3. Known Issues

-So, at one point I tried to do some shenanigans with duplicate versions of civics to get around a restriction in how Stellaris formats civic requirements. This introduced a lot of weird issues. I undid this but left intact "legacy" versions of the no-longer-needed civics that can only be seen by empires that already have them (i.e., can't be selected at start, will continue to exist for empires that have them in saved games). This may also result in duplicates showing up sometimes. Your game's not broken, you're just seeing vestigial crap.
-In the base game, certain events (the Prethoryn and Unbidden crises, most critically) check to see if the player has certain set defined governments to determine what response to give. However, the default "OK" response doesn't start the crisis events. This means that if you're using any mod-added governments, it doesn't seem that you can start the crises. Fortunately, there is a mod out there that fixes this: Event Bugfixes by ECHO (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785269836)

4. Future Plans

-More customization: start screen text, name lists, AI personalities. Basically I want this mod to inject a huge amount of flavor into the game, and that means a gradual process of adding new things. It's fun! But time consuming.

-More of a focus on government types that are just variations on ones in the base game, using just ethos combinations and maybe a few base game civics.

-Two plans I have for expansion will be released as new, separate mods. The first will add "advanced" civics that should radically change the way you play. The second will focus on hive minds.

-New Authority types: This is going to be tough because what I have planned - adding hereditary versions of Democratic and Oligarchic authorities - doesn't really gel with the way succession works in the game. I'll have to monkey around with events.

-Eventually I'd like to include some events for specific governments, like succession crises and such. But this is a long ways off.

4. Compatibility

The field of civics mods has gotten more crowded, so I figured it would make sense to make a note about compatibility. This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files. That said, there's no guarantee that all the civic combinations between my mods and others will make sense or be balanced. Also, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best.

WARNING: I haven't exactly tested any of these in new games. So please do tell me if anything is broken, or unbalanced, or you have a better idea for something. It's very WIP right now.
