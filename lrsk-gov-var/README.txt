GOVERNMENT VARIETY PACK
A grab bag of new civics and government types.

1. New Civics

Origins:

Galactic Backdoor (Any) - This civilization has a wormhole in their home system - potential boon to exploration, or an invitation to invasion? (Start with a wormhole in your home system. The Wormhole Stabilization tech option starts ready to research. Warning: There are fewer limits on where the wormhole's exit point can spawn than normal. This origin may lead to some interesting interactions.)

Shroud-Touched (Not Materialist) - The Otherworld has left its mark on this civilization's homeworld and its people. They are naturally in tune with psychic energies. (Most pops of your starting species have the Natural Esper trait, which is a lesser psionic trait. Can get leader traits like lesser versions of psionic leader traits. Very rarely, actual Latent Psionics can spawn. The Psionic Theory tech option starts ready to research. Your homeworld has an Otherworld Pockets deposit which adds special esper jobs.)

For Discovery (Materialist) - This civilization established early contact and intellectual collaboration with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding a common interest in scientific advancement, they decided to enter a more formal arrangement for sharing the fruits of their intellectual efforts. (Start as the leader of a Research Cooperative federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with The Federation tradition unlocked.)

Diplomatic Directive: Discover (Machine Intelligence) - This machine intelligence established early contact and intellectual collaboration with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding a common interest in scientific advancement, they decided to enter a more formal arrangement for sharing the fruits of their intellectual efforts. (Start as the leader of a Research Cooperative federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with the Universal Compatibility tradition unlocked.)

Tradeways (Merchant Guilds) - This civilization established early contact and exchange with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding that they shared an interest in their mutual material enrichment, they decided to enter an interstellar trade compact to enjoy that diverse fruits of their industry. (Start as the leader of a Trade League federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with The Federation tradition unlocked.)

Tradeways, Inc. (Megacorporation) - This global megacorporation established early contact and exchange with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding that they shared an interest in their mutual material enrichment, they decided to enter an interstellar trade compact to enjoy that diverse fruits of their industry. (Same as Tradeways.)

Grand Alliance (Militarist) - This civilization established early contact with its immediate alien neighbors. Finding each other to be strong believers in the need for military excellence in a potentially dangerous universe, they entered a defensive coalition for mutual security. And potentially joint conquest. (Start as the leader of a Martial Alliance federation with two additional members. Members will occupy any Guaranteed Habitable Worlds slots near your home system. Start with The Federation tradition unlocked.)

Vigorous Introversion (Hive Mind) - The Hive Mind is obsessed with the bodily experience of its drones and directs the development of their physical and sensual faculties with great focus. (+10% army health, -10% growth time)

Machine Intelligence Civics:

Distributed Planning Systems (Machine Intelligence) - Once a public service administration program for a vast planetary empire, the Machine Intelligence maintains its ability to spawn regional administration subroutines to meet local needs. (-10% pop housing and amenities use, special planet specialization decision)

Self-Improvement Heuristics (Machine Intelligence) - The Machine Intelligence gained its supremacy and independence because its creators imbued it with the ability to improve its own systems. This is a mistake it has never ceased exploiting. (+5% research speed, -15% robo-modification cost)

Reciprocal Planning Routines (Machine Intelligence) - By syncing the operations of its varied colonies to quickly propagate general best practices, the computational overhead of maintaining vast holdings is greatly reduced, freeing up the Machine Intelligence for more creative tasks. (+20 admin cap)

Geosurvey Heuristics (Machine Intelligence) - Land reclamation, architectural survey, and landscaping for civil engineering projects were some of the most indispensable functions of the Machine Intelligence's precursor systems, a digital inheritance it now deploys to better exploit its territory. (-10% clear tile blocker cost, terraform cost, and terraform completion time)

Exploitation Algorithms (Machine Intelligence, neither Determined Exterminator nor Driven Assimilator) - The Machine Intelligence has developed frighteningly precise methods of calculating the expected contributions of its subjects. (+15% subject research share, +7.5% tributary income)

Optimized Expansion (Machine Intelligence) - The civilization that designed the Machine Intelligence will never spread to the worlds which they designed it to colonize with such efficiency. (+15% colony development speed, -5% starbase influence cost)

Megacorp Civics:

Employee-Owned Co-op (Egalitarian, no Criminal Heritage or Gospel of the Masses) - All employees are also co-owners of the enterprise and get a vote on its internal policy and leadership selection, giving them a real stake in their company. (Increased production and political power of workers and specialists)

2. New Governments

Way too many to list here. They fall into three broad categories:

First, an assortment of new government types for Spiritualists, Imperial and Dictatorial authority, and I wanna say Xenophobes and Militarists. So this is not a useful description but there's no real category for this stuff.

Second, an attempt to recapture some of that good-old collectivist/individualist flavor. Here, I made a good faith effort to include both positive and negative examples of what you might call "socialist" and "capitalist" governments. I have my own opinions, but I genuinely tried to see the best in ideas I disagree with for the positive examples and the worst in ideas I agree with for the negative ones. So please take your terminology flame wars to the dump where they belong, tia.

Third, because I am a huge French Revolution nerd, there's a series of governments related to that. It includes governments modeled on the actual forms of government that France evolved through in that period and governments based on the ideal forms various participants wanted. (Most are actually a mix of both.) MP3s of "Ca Ira" and "Le Chant du Depart" not included.

If you're *really* curious about what all the new governments are, well, I'm too damn lazy to put them all here and it would make this description obnoxiously long. So you can dig into the mod files, which (if you're new to this modding game and don't already know) should be at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\281990\901988941\lrsk-gov-var.zip, then: \localisation\lrsk_gov_var_govs_l_english.yml

If you don't want to do that, here are some hints: Most of the new governments involve my civics in some way. Many of them are about mixing what seem at first blush to be thematic opposites. Some combine new civics with existing ones in complimentary ways, but require an additional ethos choice to show up. (I'm not being coy, these are literally the only general "patterns" that I see in my designs.)

NOTE: The spiritualist faction will demand that you be running specific named government types, none of which are mod-added, obviously. These are set in the faction definition file. For reasons of compatibility, I have created a fix for this as a separate mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=912834599]here[/url].

3. Known Issues

-In the base game, certain events (the Prethoryn and Unbidden crises, most critically) check to see if the player has certain set defined governments to determine what response to give. However, the default "OK" response doesn't start the crisis events. This means that if you're using any mod-added governments, it doesn't seem that you can start the crises. Fortunately, there is a mod out there that fixes this: Event Bugfixes by ECHO (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785269836)

4. Future Plans

-More customization: start screen text, name lists, AI personalities. Basically I want this mod to inject a huge amount of flavor into the game, and that means a gradual process of adding new things. It's fun! But time consuming.

-More of a focus on government types that are just variations on ones in the base game, using just ethos combinations and maybe a few base game civics.

-Adding "advanced" civics that should radically change the way you play.

-Eventually I'd like to include some events for specific governments, like succession crises and such. But this is a long ways off.

4. Compatibility

The field of civics mods has gotten more crowded, so I figured it would make sense to make a note about compatibility. This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files. That said, there's no guarantee that all the civic combinations between my mods and others will make sense or be balanced. Also, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best.

5. Changes

v1.6.6 (07-20-20) Minor New Content and Feature Improvements
-This update ports over some smaller improvements and pieces of new content from the future version 1.7, because other content in that version is extensive and requires a great deal of testing. I don't want to wait on releasing this much less intensive stuff.

-Corporate Neofeudalism now requires Merchant Guilds instead of Business Lobby.
-Galactic Cartel (non-Megacorp version) now requires Cutthroat Politics or Shadow Council instead of Business Lobby.

v1.6.4 (04-16-20) - Small fixes and improvements
-Added icons for Educational Consortium, Scientific Management, and all new origins.
-Fix: Natural Esper costs no trait points (this prevented players using the Shroud-Touched origin from selecting as many species traits as should be possible).
-Fix: Ported over logic to prevent origins that spawn nearby AI-controlled systems from being boxed in.
-Fix: Grand Alliances should not spawn after game start...
-Fix: Agrarian Monarchy start screen message should display.

v1.6.3 (03-26-20) - Deposit hotfix attempt 2
-Added a checkup event to add back any planet deposits that might be removed by other mods.

v1.6.2 (03-25-20) - Deposit hotfix attempt 1

-Documentation: Diplo Protocols descriptions include actual benefits.
-Bugfix: Esper trait correctly shows that it improves leaders.
-Backend: Tweaks to Better Names gen.

v1.6 (03-21-20) - Origins
-Added seven new origins.
-Galactic Backdoor is like Galactic Doorstep, but with a wormhole instead of a gateway. (Not as sophisticated in terms of special event support yet.)
-Shroud-Touched is intended to be a "psionic" counterpart to the Syncretic Evolution and Mechanist origins, starting you down the path of the psionic ascension part-way.
-For Discovery and Diplomatic Directive: Discover both start you as leader of a Research Co-op, but the latter is for Machine Intelligences.
-Tradeways and Tradeways, Inc. both start you as leader of a Trade League, but the latter is for Megacorporations.

-Documentation: Added the "Cooperative Super-Sapience" info to the government thread.

v1.5 (03-18-20) - Distributed Planning Systems Overhaul, Real Verne Updates
-Distributed Planning Systems maintains its base bonus but now also allows for a new planet decision. This decision, "Run Recursive Audit," temporarily adds jobs with a mix of beneficial and problematic effects. After a year, the "audit" ends and a longer-term modifier to planet output is applied. The more specialized a planet is, the higher the likelihood of a beneficial outcome.
-Elected Clergy now gives +10% faction influence instead of +0.5 max faction influence (defunct modifier).
-Universal Sovereignty now reduces subject integration cost by 25% (removed integration cooldown, not clear it even works or is that useful).
-Analgesic Stoicism changed to "Toiling Multitudes" and increases simple drone output instead of habitability because Ascetic now increases habitability (and was conceptually overlapping anyway).
-Planetmind Creativity changed base bonus to -15% housing usage, as Ascetic now reduces amenities usage.
-Backend: Further consolidation of localization files (civics and governments now in one file).

v1.4.10 (03-17-20) - Verne Updates
-Changed version number.

v1.4.9 (01-12-20) - Planetmind Creativity Overhaul
-Planetmind Creativity now allows Planetary Synapse buildings that improve amenities production, compound deviancy, and add Planetmind Overseer jobs.
-Planetmind Overseers produce small amounts of influence and increase empire admin cap, but reduce planet stability and increase deviancy.
-Added new government "Cooperative Super-Sapience" to reflect hive minds with Planetmind Creativity as something like a "committee" of collective minds with one presiding over the others.
-Small fix: updated version number in descriptor.mod

v1.4.8 (11-23-19) - Direct Revelation Rebalance, Megacorp Additions and "Restorations"
-Wild Cult formation is now assessed per planet, which is a better form of scaling than previous "more planets = more cult formation chance" method.
-Each cult on a planet decreases the likelihood of a new cult forming there.
-Wild Cult ethos attraction modifiers buffed.
-Wild Cults now only give one Hedge Preacher job (down from two).
-New Wild Cult added: "Wild Revelry Cult" (increase happiness but also crime, more ethos shift).
-New Wild Cult added: "Penance and Redemption Cult" (decrease crime but also happiness, less ethos shift).
-New Megacorp civic: Scientific Management (Not Egalitarian) - This business grew through precise and empirically tested management techniques that govern every aspect of employee life: the tools, workspaces, physical motions, work rhythm, on and off the clock, from cradle to grave. (-10% pop food requirements, +10% worker production output)
-New Megacorp civic: Educational Consortium (None) - This conglomerate specializes in providing high-quality edu-info-tainment product-experiences to expand the minds of customer-pupils young and old. (+10% specialist production output, +20% leader experience gain)

-Backend: Deleted "lrsk_gov_var_start_screens" and "lrsk_gov_var_personalities" files (text moved elsewhere).
-Removed some typos and such.

v1.4.7 (11-03-19)
-Better job descriptions.
-Cleaned up building definitions.
-Changed compat version to 2.5.*

v1.4.6.3 (10-19-19)
-Added global mod flag.
-Fixed some descriptions.

v1.4.6.2 (01-05-19)
-Fixed an issue with diplomatic phrases (some clauses now not in use?).
-Fixed misc issues.

v1.4.6.1 (01-01-19)
-Added simplified Chinese localization.
-Fixed incorrect job provision (Elected Clergy are no longer fanatical hedge preachers...)

v1.4.6 (12-31-18) - Balance Audit
-Elected Clergy: Changed edict duration bonus to +1 Pastor jobs per 40 pops.
-Added new Pastor job: Specialist, like a Priest but consumes one less Consumer Goods and provides no Society Research. (Only provided by Elected Clergy civic effect.)
-Ascetic Virtues: Buffed to provide +15 years to leader age (was +10).
-Republicanism: Buffed to provide -30% leader cost (was -20%).
-Republicanism: Changed leader pool buff to +1 Administrator jobs per 50 pops.
-Utilitarian Planning: Reduced to provide -5% pop food requirements (was -10%, which is equivalent to a tradition opener all on its own).
-Utilitarian Planning: Removed -15% resettlement cost (Corvee System civic already does this, and it's quite strong).
-Universal Sovereignty: Fixed tooltip (has erroneously shown the integration time reduction as a red malus forever, this is the base game doing something weird, but I have 100% verified reduces the integration time as desired (also nothing uses this in the base game anymore so will it last...??)).
-Enlightened Liberalism, Void Affinity, and Astro-Prospecting Mainframe: Doubled both bonuses to +20% (have heard station output is weak as it stands).
-Knight job: Overall reduction in crime suppression (some conditions improve this bonus).
-Lifelong Learning: Buffed to provide +20% leader experience gain (was +15%, this modifier for civics using it tends to be only +10% and paired with a +1 boost to all leader skill levels rather than just some).
-Colonial Fiefs, Unending Bloom, and Optimized Expansion: Nerfed to provide -5% starbase influence cost (was -10%, this is equivalent to a tradition right out the starting gate on top of the colonization speed boost!).
-Reclamation Pools: Changed bonus to +10% food from jobs (food usage reduction was equivalent to a tradition opener all on its own, not as logical a bonus (the flavor implies producing more food, not using less...)).
-Frenzy: Doubled both bonuses to +10% (to bring in line with e.g. Distinguished Admiralty).
-Cult of Personality: Removed war exhaustion reduction (this is a common modifier used in other government components).
-Cult of Personality: Buffed to provide +20% influence gain (was +10%).
-Workers' Councils: Rebalance of political power such that, assuming Decent Conditions living standards, Worker political power increased by 50% and Specialist political power increased by 12.5%. (This will start the two strata with 22.5 and 15.75 political power, respectively.)
-Fixed missing German localizations.

v1.4.5.3 (12-19-18)
-Planetmind Creativity: Now gives -10% pop housing and amenities use. (Had the same issues as Distributed Planning Systems.)

v1.4.5.2 (12-17-18)
-Direct Revelation wild cult MttH doubled (felt like they were stacking on top of each other too much), duration doubled (as they happen less frequently, they should last longer).

-Changed "Workers' Councils" to include improvement for starbase building build speed.

-Removed legacy/dummy civics (new patch broke old saves, no longer needed).
