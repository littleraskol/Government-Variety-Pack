GOVERNMENT VARIETY PACK
A grab bag of new civics and government types.

1. New Civics

Workers' Councils (Egalitarian, no Business Lobby or Shared Burdens) - Trade unions, democratic workplaces, and cooperatives are a vital part of civil society and an integral part of government. (-5% building and ship construction time, increased happiness and political power of workers and spcialists.)

(+20 admin cap)

Geosurvey Heuristics (Machine Intelligence) - Land reclamation, architectural survey, and landscaping for civil engineering projects were some of the most indispensable functions of the Machine Intelligence's precursor systems, a digital inheritance it now deploys to better exploit its territory. (-10% clear tile blocker cost, terraform cost, and terraform completion time)

Exploitation Algorithms (Machine Intelligence, neither Determined Exterminator nor Driven Assimilator) - The Machine Intelligence has developed frighteningly precise methods of calculating the expected contributions of its subjects. (+15% subject research share, +7.5% tributary income)

2. New Governments

Way too many to list here. They fall into three broad categories:

First, an assortment of new government types for Spiritualists, Imperial and Dictatorial authority, and I wanna say Xenophobes and Militarists. So this is not a useful description but there's no real category for this stuff.

Second, an attempt to recapture some of that good-old collectivist/individualist flavor. Here, I made a good faith effort to include both positive and negative examples of what you might call "socialist" and "capitalist" governments. I have my own opinions, but I genuinely tried to see the best in ideas I disagree with for the positive examples and the worst in ideas I agree with for the negative ones. So please take your terminology flame wars to the dump where they belong, tia.

Third, because I am a huge French Revolution nerd, there's a series of governments related to that. It includes governments modeled on the actual forms of government that France evolved through in that period and governments based on the ideal forms various participants wanted. (Most are actually a mix of both.) MP3s of "Ca Ira" and "Le Chant du Depart" not included.

If you're *really* curious about what all the new governments are, well, I'm too damn lazy to put them all here and it would make this description obnoxiously long. So you can dig into the mod files, which (if you're new to this modding game and don't already know) should be at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\281990\901988941\lrsk-gov-var.zip, then: \localisation\lrsk_gov_var_govs_l_english.yml

If you don't want to do that, here are some hints: Most of the new governments involve my civics in some way. Many of them are about mixing what seem at first blush to be thematic opposites. Some combine new civics with existing ones in complimentary ways, but require an additional ethos choice to show up. (I'm not being coy, these are literally the only general "patterns" that I see in my designs.)

NOTE: The spiritualist faction will demand that you be running specific named government types, none of which are mod-added, obviously. These are set in the faction definition file. For reasons of compatibility, I have created a fix for this as a separate mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=912834599]here[/url].

3. Known Issues

-In the base game, certain events (the Prethoryn and Unbidden crises, most critically) check to see if the player has certain set defined governments to determine what response to give. However, the default "OK" response doesn't start the crisis events. This means that if you're using any mod-added governments, it doesn't seem that you can start the crises. Fortunately, there is a mod out there that fixes this: Event Bugfixes by ECHO (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785269836)

4. Future Plans

-More customization: start screen text, name lists, AI personalities. Basically I want this mod to inject a huge amount of flavor into the game, and that means a gradual process of adding new things. It's fun! But time consuming.

-More of a focus on government types that are just variations on ones in the base game, using just ethos combinations and maybe a few base game civics.

-Adding "advanced" civics that should radically change the way you play.

-Eventually I'd like to include some events for specific governments, like succession crises and such. But this is a long ways off.

4. Compatibility

The field of civics mods has gotten more crowded, so I figured it would make sense to make a note about compatibility. This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files. That said, there's no guarantee that all the civic combinations between my mods and others will make sense or be balanced. Also, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best.

-Removed legacy/dummy civics (new patch broke old saves, no longer needed).

-Updated to 1.5.1

WARNING: I haven't exactly tested any of these in new games. So please do tell me if anything is broken, or unbalanced, or you have a better idea for something. It's very WIP right now.
