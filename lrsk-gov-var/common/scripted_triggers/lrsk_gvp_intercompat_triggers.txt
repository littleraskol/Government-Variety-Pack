# Government Variety Pack
# Scripted Triggers - Mod Inter-Compatibility
# Author: littleraskol

# These triggers replace checks for various government features, enabling other mods or patches to overload them and improve compatbility.

# In 3.13, the base game has moved to using is_authority triggers instead of checking for specific authorities. I expect that modders will eventually just start overriding those.
# In the meantime, some mods will still use the modder-created has_auth_whatever standard. This passes one through the other so all overrides should work.
