# Star Siblings (Not Xenophobe) - This species has been in irregular communications with another alien species for as long as t #has had radio technology. The two species cultures have had a lasting influence on each other, and they both look forward to the day they can meet heir #sisters and brothers by another stellar mother. (Starts the game in contact and friendly relations with another alien empire.)
