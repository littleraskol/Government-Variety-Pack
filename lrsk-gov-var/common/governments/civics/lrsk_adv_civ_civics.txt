#Shapers (Not Essentialists or Artificers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that it is life that matters most to living beings, and its careful cultivation is the highest purpose of knowledge. (+5 leader age, -10% genetic modification cost, +10% habitability, -5% non-society research from jobs, start with "Eco Simulation" tech.)

#Artificers (Not Essentialists or Shapers) - In the philosophical-ideological dispute over the value of knowledge, this society ultimately decided that the things sapient beings create, their tools and crafts, that matter most.

#Techno-Barbarism (Spiritualist, Authoritarian, can't have certain civics) - The superstitious heirs to an advanced civilization, they have forgotten more of science than most empires ever discover. Unfortunately, they remember little and misunderstand much of that. Fortunately, their technology was designed very well. (Techno-Ritual Reverence policies that can improve ship hull, shields, armor, evasion, and damage, -10% building upkeep, cost, and build speed, +15% army damage and health, -10% research speed, -1 research alternative, +20% scientist recruit cost)
