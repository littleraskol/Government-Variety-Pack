A grab bag of new civics and government types.

[i][b]New Civics[/b][/i]

A total of [b]62 new civics[/b], broken down into 7 origins, 20 normal civics, 19 hive civics, 14 machine civics, and 2 megacorp civics. (This last category will grow.) Even short summaries cannot be contained in the character limit so see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/901988941/1692662484253758433/]the dedicated civics thread[/url] for detailed descriptions.

[i][b]New Governments[/b][/i]

Around [b]56 new governments[/b] (I may have lost count at some point!) spread across nearly all authority types and combining vanilla and VGP-added civics. There are also listed in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/901988941/1318835718938058107/]their own thread[/url]. The requirements for making them are in the first reply to that thread.

[i][b]Special Thanks[/b][/i]

[b]ICONS[/B]:Wanna give a HUGE THANK YOU to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/meltup/]Meltup[/url] for making unique icons for the new civics. They look cool and I am super happy someone stepped up to help out with this.

[i][b]Compatibility[/b][/i]

This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files. However, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best.

There are a few patches and other versions of this mod:
