[i][b]New Governments[/b][/i]

Way too many to list here, so I created a discussion thread to list them all. The requirements for making them are in the first reply to that thread.

[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] The spiritualist faction will demand that you be running specific named government types, none of which are mod-added, obviously. These are set in the faction definition file. For reasons of compatibility, I have created a fix for this as a separate mod [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=912834599]here[/url].  

[i][b]Special Thanks[/b][/i]

[b]ICONS[/B]:Wanna give a HUGE THANK YOU to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/meltup/]Meltup[/url] for making unique icons for the new civics. They look cool and I am super happy someone stepped up to help out with this.

[b]TRANSLATIONS[/B]: Steam user [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022410719][FRANCE] PAYAN[/url] has made a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=910836075]French translation[/url] of the mod.

[i][b]Known Issues[/b][/i]

See "Balance Issues & Bug Reports" thread below.

[i][b]Compatibility[/b][/i]

The field of civics mods has gotten more crowded, so I figured it would make sense to make a note about compatibility. This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files. That said, there's no guarantee that all the civic combinations between my mods and others will make sense or be balanced. Also, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best.
