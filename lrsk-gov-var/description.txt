[i][b]New Governments[/b][/i]

Way too many to list here, so I created a discussion thread to list them all. The requirements for making them are in the first reply to that thread.

[i][b]Special Thanks[/b][/i]

[b]ICONS[/B]:Wanna give a HUGE THANK YOU to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/meltup/]Meltup[/url] for making unique icons for the new civics. They look cool and I am super happy someone stepped up to help out with this.

[i][b]Compatibility[/b][/i]

This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files. However, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best.

There are a few patches and other versions of this mod:
[list]
[*]Civics Variety Patch - Only civics, no governments.
[*]Origins Variety Patch - Only origins.
[*]Lesser Names Patch - Removes the "Better Names" functionality.
[*]No Origins Patch - Removes all origins.
