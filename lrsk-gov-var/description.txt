A grab bag of new civics and government types.

[i]This is a backup version for Stellaris v.2.6.* (Verne).[/i] It will be kept somewhat up-to-date with content that works in 2.6, but at a certain point new patch features will become too difficult to maintain. The current version can be founf here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=901988941]Government Variety Pack (Current)[/url]

[i][b]New Civics[/b][/i]

A total of [b]62 new civics[/b], broken down into 7 origins, 20 normal civics, 19 hive civics, 14 machine civics, and 2 megacorp civics. (This last category will grow.) Even short summaries cannot be contained in the character limit so see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/901988941/1692662484253758433/]the dedicated civics thread[/url] for detailed descriptions.

[i][b]New Governments[/b][/i]

Around [b]75 new governments[/b] (I may have lost count at some point!) spread across nearly all authority types and combining vanilla and GVP-added civics. They are also listed in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/901988941/1318835718938058107/]their own thread[/url]. The requirements for making them are in the first reply to that thread.

[i][b]Special Thanks[/b][/i]

[b]ICONS[/B]
Wanna give a HUGE THANK YOU to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/meltup/]Meltup[/url] for making unique icons for the new civics. They look cool and I am super happy someone stepped up to help out with this.

[b]Other Contributors[/b]
Steam user [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025179504]Namazuo "Horse Poop" Toushiro[/url] came up with something like 17 new government suggestions that were all awesome, I added them and they served as the inspiration for a few more.

[i][b]Compatibility and Patches[/b][/i]

First up, this is [b][i]super incompatible[/i][/b] with the mod's current version, so [i]don't run them together![/i]

This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files, and will only conflict with other mods if for some reason another mod has files with the exact same names in the same places as this in mod. However, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best. There's also no guarantee that combinations of mod-added features will "play nice" or be balanced against/with each other in game.

There are a few patches and other versions of this mod. These all require the main GVP mod (this), and do nothing but selectively remove features. [b]If you want all the features of this mod, you don't need any of these patches/alternate versions.[/b] They do not add anything and only provide options for users who for whatever reason want to exclude some features.

The patches and alternate versions are:
