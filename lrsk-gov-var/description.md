A grab bag of new civics, origins, and government types.

[b]Newly updated for Stellaris 4.0 (Phoenix)[/b] - This is a big one. I've made sure that it doesn't throw and errors on load, and done some sanity checking of everything that touches pops, but have not had time (nor do I expect to have time) for a detailed test of everything that was changed.

[i][b]New Civics[/b][/i]

A total of [b]77 new civics[/b], broken down into 9 origins, 20 normal civics, 19 hive civics, 14 machine civics, 12 megacorp civics, and 3 "advanced" civics available to any non-gestalt empire. Additionally, 5 base game civics have been enhanced with expanded features. (See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2806903835/4839692156559653486/]the dedicated civics thread[/url] for more info.)

[i][b]New Governments[/b][/i]

Around [b]95-105 new governments[/b] (depending on how one counts), detailed in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2806903835/4839692156559694926/]their own thread[/url].

[i][b]Special Thanks[/b][/i]

[b]ICONS[/B]
Wanna give a HUGE THANK YOU to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/meltup/]Meltup[/url] for making unique icons for the new civics. They look cool and I am super happy someone stepped up to help out with this.

[i][b]Compatibility, Patches, and Submods[/b][/i]

This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files, and will only conflict with other mods if for some reason another mod has files with the exact same names in the same places as this in mod. However, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best. There's also no guarantee that combinations of mod-added features will "play nice" or be balanced against/with each other in game.

Compatibility patches:
[list]

[*]While there isn't any built-in compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1100284147]Ethics and Civics Classic[/url] maintained by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Coggernaut]Coggernaut[/url], GVP is safe to run with it. A patch will be produced, eventually.

Want to make a compatibility or localization patch? [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2806903835/3423311880045971276/]See this post to find out how[/url]!

There are a few patches and other versions of this mod. These all require the main GVP mod (this), and do nothing but selectively remove features. [b]If you want all the features of this mod, you don't need any of these patches/alternate versions.[/b] They do not add anything and only provide options for users who for whatever reason want to exclude some features. Since all they do is replace files from GVP with identically-named blank files, there isn't typically much need to update them and tbh it's kind of a chore to update the version number on all these so I'm slow to do it. Bottom line, [b]you can almost certainly ignore the compatible version number for them[/b].

The patches and alternate versions are:
[list]
[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=924072507]Civics Variety Patch[/url] - Only civics (including origins), no governments.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2029865238]Origins Variety Patch[/url] - Only origins.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2029864772]No Origins Patch[/url] - Removes all origins.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1591858476]Lesser Names Patch[/url] - Removes the "Better Names" functionality from base game governments.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2345045872]No Enhanced Civics[/url] - Removes "enhanced" features of base game civics.
[/list]

There are also "backup" versions of this mod for older versions of Stellaris available on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/littleraskol/myworkshopfiles/?appid=281990]my Workshop page[/url]. [b]NOTE: The backup versions are stand-alone, do not run any of them with each other or the current version![/b]


Finally, there is a submod available:
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884243461]Chivalric Peacekeepers[/url] - Changes the requirements of Chivalry, allowing it to be selected by any empire that is not Fanatic Pacifist. (maintained by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/lunaassassin98/]Luna Assassin[/url]).

[i][b]Known Issues[/b][/i]

Federation start origins may rarely spawn partners with no government ("Despicable Neutrals"). The reason is known but the fix is obscure. If this happens to you, at this time the best thing to do is start a new game. It only happens occasionally.
