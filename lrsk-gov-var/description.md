A grab bag of new civics, origins, and government types.

[b]Known Issue:[/b] A base game bug prevents Holy Covenants from having names. I have implemented a partial fix that should work 99.9% of the time.

[i][b]New Civics[/b][/i]

A total of [b]75 new civics[/b], broken down into 10 origins, 22 normal civics, 19 hive civics, 14 machine civics, 13 megacorp civics, and 3 "advanced" civics available to any non-gestalt empire. Additionally, 5 base game civics have been enhanced with expanded features. See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2806903835/4839692156559653486/]the dedicated civics thread[/url] for details.

[i][b]New Governments[/b][/i]

Around [b]85-90 new governments[/b] also listed in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2806903835/4839692156559694926/]their own thread[/url]. The requirements for making them are in the first reply to that thread.

[i][b]Special Thanks[/b][/i]

[b]ICONS[/B]
Wanna give a HUGE THANK YOU to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/meltup/]Meltup[/url] for making unique icons for the new civics. They look cool and I am super happy someone stepped up to help out with this.

[i][b]Compatibility, Patches, and Submods[/b][/i]

This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files, and will only conflict with other mods if for some reason another mod has files with the exact same names in the same places as this in mod. However, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best. There's also no guarantee that combinations of mod-added features will "play nice" or be balanced against/with each other in game.

Compaitibility patches exist for a few mods. Some are maintained by me, and some by the other mod's author. They are:
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2111525145]Ethics & Civics Overhaul/Government Variety Pack Patch[/url] for the Ethics and Civics [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1100284147]Classic[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1790861374]Alternative[/url] mods. It will likely work on any fork of these mods as well. (Maintained by me.)

Want to make a compatibility or localization patch? [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2806903835/3423311880045971276/]See this post to find out how[/url]!

There are a few patches and other versions of this mod. These all require the main GVP mod (this), and do nothing but selectively remove features. [b]If you want all the features of this mod, you don't need any of these patches/alternate versions.[/b] They do not add anything and only provide options for users who for whatever reason want to exclude some features. Since all they do is replace files from GVP with identically-named blank files, there isn't typically much need to update them and tbh it's kind of a chore to update the version number on all these so I'm slow to do it. Bottom line, [b]you can almost certainly ignore the compatible version number for them[/b].

The patches and alternate versions are:
[list]
[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=924072507]Civics Variety Patch[/url] - Only civics (including origins), no governments.

[/list]
