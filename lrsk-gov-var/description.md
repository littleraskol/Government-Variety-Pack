A grab bag of new civics, origins, and government types.

[i][b]New Civics[/b][/i]

A total of [b]72 new civics[/b], broken down into 7 origins, 20 normal civics, 19 hive civics, 14 machine civics, and 11 megacorp civics. Additionally, 5 base game civics have been enhanced with expanded features. Even short summaries cannot be contained in the character limit so see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2601883293/3041607712767147161/]the dedicated civics thread[/url] for detailed descriptions.

[i][b]New Governments[/b][/i]

Around [b]80 new governments[/b] (I may have lost count at some point!) spread across nearly all authority types and combining vanilla and GVP-added civics. They are also listed in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2601883293/3041607712767149436/]their own thread[/url]. The requirements for making them are in the first reply to that thread.

[i][b]Special Thanks[/b][/i]

[b]ICONS[/B]
Wanna give a HUGE THANK YOU to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/meltup/]Meltup[/url] for making unique icons for the new civics. They look cool and I am super happy someone stepped up to help out with this.

[*]Steam user [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025179504]Namazuo "Horse Poop" Toushiro[/url] came up with something like 17 new government suggestions that were all awesome, I added them and they served as the inspiration for a few more.
[*]Steam user [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019142950]Garlic Pudding[/url] came up with four government ideas I incorporated, and one I have yet to incorporate but a new Civic is WIP for it.

[i][b]Compatibility and Patches[/b][/i]

This mod only adds new things to the game, in new files. There's no possibility of my mod conflicting with another due to both editing base game files, and will only conflict with other mods if for some reason another mod has files with the exact same names in the same places as this in mod. However, if a mod radically changes the way ethics work (especially renaming the base ethics), compatibility will be shaky at best. There's also no guarantee that combinations of mod-added features will "play nice" or be balanced against/with each other in game.

Compaitibility patches exist for a few mods. Some are maintained by me, and some by the other mod's author. They are:

There are a few patches and other versions of this mod. These all require the main GVP mod (this), and do nothing but selectively remove features. [b]If you want all the features of this mod, you don't need any of these patches/alternate versions.[/b] They do not add anything and only provide options for users who for whatever reason want to exclude some features.

The patches and alternate versions are:
