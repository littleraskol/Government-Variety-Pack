So, this is a list of requirements for different governments. Here I would be interested in an opinion on a particular point: Is it better to make my new governments generally require my new civics? Or to focus effort on making new governments with base game civics and ethos combinations (to diversify what's available in the base game)?

If you're confused by certain combinations, keep in mind the design philosophy I outlined in the first post. These are the highest-level governments and are designed according to how they'd look from without.

Note: When I say the name of an ethos, assume either normal or Fanatic is fine (unless that would be impossible for some reason; some requirements are implicit). If I say "basic" before the ethos, I mean the non-Fanatic version. If something seems weirdly lacking, check the requirements for required civics.
