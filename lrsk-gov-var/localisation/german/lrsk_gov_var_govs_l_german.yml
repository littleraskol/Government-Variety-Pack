 lrsk_gov_var_gov_libertarian_freehold_desc:0 "This government is the result of an extreme experiment in privatization where all functions of government were contracted out to various businesses. Only the legislature and courts remain as government entities, with the highest judge in the empire having assumed certain executive powers by default."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_JUSTICE$"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_LIBERTARIAN_FREEHOLD:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their bloated bureaucracies. Then an innovation in statecraft took hold: we let more nimble and efficient businesses start doing the government's work. Now our planetary government mostly serves to set the standards for private contractors and to see justice done when anyone's rights are violated."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_anarcho_capitalism:0 "Anarcho-Capitalism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_anarcho_capitalism_desc:0 "This government is theoretically no government at all, as all functions of a normal government have been distributed to various competing private entities, even law-enforcement and justice. Only a single position, a dispute-resolver of last resort, remains as anything resembling an officer of a sovereign state."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_INSPECTOR:0 "Chief Inspector"
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_INSPECTOR_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_CHIEF_INSPECTOR$"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ANARCHO_CAPITALISM:0 "In the early days, our people were imprisoned and extorted by states. We groaned under the violent demands of kings and bureaucrats. Slowly, freedom-lovers realized that businesses, charities, and civil associations could do everything a state could without coercion. The revolution saw states swept aside and replaced with a variety of voluntary, competitive dispute resolution organizations and covenant communities. Only one vestigial position of government remains to provide a light moderating force."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_neofuedalism:0 "Corporate Neofeudalism"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_corporate_neofuedalism_desc:0 "This government didn't merely contract out its functions to businesses, it is the result of decentralizing government to regional or local scale and running states as businesses, under the forward-thinking guidance of a new aristocracy of wealth. On a global scale, the corporate overlords entrust foreign affairs and the military to a hired agent."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_AMBAS_AGENT_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_AMBAS_AGENT$"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_CORPORATE_NEOFUEDALISM:0 "Our people were once mismanaged by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their idiotic commitment to 'equality.' Only with time did we learn the virtue of inequality and the power of innovative disruption. The ultimate disruption in the realm of a politics beholden to inept corporate interests was to cut the government down to size, and then to cut out the middlemen and run governments like businesses, with our best and brightest entrepreneurs at the helm."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_proprietary_franchise:0 "Proprietary Franchise"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_proprietary_franchise_desc:0 "This government is actually a family business that has swollen to the point that it dominates whatever vestigial state nominally governs society.

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_PROPRIETARY_FRANCHISE:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by inefficient republics and pompous royal dynasties. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of merchant families grew steadily. Eventually one cunning and ruthless family business managed to corner the market in nearly every sector and become the de facto rulers of the world. States still operate, other businesses still serve niche markets, but everyone knows better than to disturb the family's bottom line. It's just better to let their money keep rolling in."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTREPRENEURIAL_COUNCIL:0 "In the early days, our people were governed by huge, inefficient states. We stagnated under their bloated bureaucracies. The top became too heavy to be held up, though, and eventually nimble and hungry private enterprises became more influential and powerful than any state by virtue of their innovations. Today, a council of entrepreneurs acts as global referees for business practices to ensure that the freedom to innovate neither overwhelms customers and employees nor crowds out competition."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_enterprise_society:0 "Enterprise Society"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTERPRISE_SOCIETY:0 "Throughout our history, there has been a struggle between those who believed in freedom and the excellence it brings, and those who believe in 'equality' no matter how much squalor and oppression it takes. We came to reject a doctrinaire insistence on 'democratic' politics if it meant forfeiting the liberty to strive and achieve and enjoy the fruits of our labor. Consequently, our republic does not permit vice, criminality, or laziness to go unpunished and keeps the underachieving masses from skewing the political process in their favor."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_enterprise_junta:0 "Enterprise Junta"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_enterprise_junta_desc:0 "This government is based on the principle that people can have great personal freedom even without political rights, and that it's probably better that way.

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_ENTERPRISE_JUNTA:0 "Throughout our history, there has been a struggle between those who believed in freedom and the excellence it brings, and those who believe in 'equality' no matter how much squalor and oppression it takes. Freedom nearly died on our world, done in by a jealous and underachieving majority given the vote. Fortunately, our wisest philosophers advised our most judicious police and military officers to stepped in to ensure that we would not suffer under a 'democracy' without the liberty to strive and achieve and enjoy the fruits of our labor."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_libertine_empire:0 "Empire of Liberty"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_libertine_empire_desc:0 "This government has a powerful monarch who is nonetheless bound by tradition and constitutional limits.

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_LIBERTINE_EMPIRE:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have known the arbitrary and unstable tyranny of aristocrats and monarchs. When the light of reason began to clear the fog of ancient prejudice and superstition, an upstart military officer perceived a better way and challenged the powers-that-be of the time, establishing a new system of free and fair rule. From that rebel's lineage, we now enjoy the dignity and strength of a monarchy that swears at each coronation to defend our liberties and punish the malefactors who threaten our peace and property."

 lrsk_gov_var_gov_rationalist_managerial_firm:0 "Rationalist-Managerial Firm"
 lrsk_gov_var_gov_rationalist_managerial_firm_desc:0 "This government is actually a kind of business enterprise that operates according to a principle of rationally planned efficiency for profit maximization. Every aspect of the lives of citizen-workers has been designed according to best practices. Local and regional governments have had their roles reduced to enforcement of waste-reduction measures."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_PROC_EFF_DIRECTOR:0 "Process Efficiency Director"
 LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_PROC_EFF_DIRECTOR_FEMALE:0 "$LRSK_GOV_VAR_RT_PROC_EFF_DIRECTOR$"

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_RMF:0 "Our society was once composed of huge, inefficient states interacting with irrationally structured businesses. This state of affairs is what makes our whole history a tragedy of wasted productivity and potential. In modern times, though, we learned the value of scientific management. At first, this was limited to precise coordination of industrial workflows and the design of tools. Soon, it encompassed lifestyle guidelines and dietary requirements. Today the most successful firm has applied the most efficient standards to all involved in the interchange of resources, labor, and marketing, and naturally its interests guide our whole political system."

 LRSK_GOV_VAR_START_SCREEN_P2_INNOVATION_INITIATIVE:0 "Our people were once mismanaged by huge, inefficient states. The monopolistic visions and orders they imposed were too inflexible for real advancement of knowledge and social organization. Only with time did we learn the virtue of inequality and the power of innovative disruption. Our most daring and successful intellectuals - scientists, scholars, inventors - combined their resources to buy out the privileges of financially failing states and institute a new system of experimentation in all things, from the advance of knowledge to the organization of governments, economies, societies, cultures, all sapient life."

The former sought to bend our minds' efforts to partisan interests and the military. The latter only cared about marginal advancements for a quick improvement in the bottom line. The desire of our people to know more, to do more, could not be hampered by this pettiness of vision forever, though. Our most daring and successful intellectuals - scientists, scholars, inventors - combined their resources to buy out the privileges of financially failing states. Now knowledge and creativity in many fields is the index of political power and our whole society's resources can be put to the task of innovation, discovery, new interpretations."

The desire of our people to know more, to do more, could not be hampered by this pettiness of vision forever, though. Our most daring and successful intellectuals - scientists, scholars, inventors - combined their efforts to teach and persuade the people, and then ran for office on a platform of dramatic governmental reform.
