The development of this playstyle comes from two special Ascension Perks you can take, but they require completing 'Ethos-appropriate' Tradition trees:\n\n- Fanatic Authoritarian: Domination, Harmony\n- Fanatic Egalitarian: Prosperity, Harmony\n- Fanatic Materialist: Discovery, Expansion\n- Fanatic Spiritualist: Harmony, Expansion\n- Fanatic Militarist: Supremacy, Domination\n- Fanatic Pacifist: Prosperity, Diplomacy\n- Fanatic Xenophile: Diplomacy, Discovery\n- Fanatic Xenophobe: Expansion, Supremacy\n\n§HThe Ethos-appropriate Traditions do not have to be unlocked in the listed order§!, but each unlocks a different first Perk for your playstyle's advancement, with different advantages.\n\nThe second of the two special Perks, §Y$lrsk_adv_civ_ap_idealistic_destiny$§!, will change up your playstyle to something more expansionist and aggressive while effecting a sort of 'cultural revolution' in the empire."

The design assumption is that you'll take whichever one goes with the first Ethos-appropriate Tradition tree you unlock first, but you can of course wait. The differing effects of these perks, and the tree that unlocks them, are below:\n\n- $lrsk_adv_civ_ap_diplomatic_aspiration$ (Diplomacy Tree): +1 Envoys, +25% Diplomatic Weight, +20% Trust Growth\n- $lrsk_adv_civ_ap_inquisitive_aspiration$ (Discovery Tree): +1 Research Alternative, +20% Research Speed, +15% Anomaly Spawn Chance\n- $lrsk_adv_civ_ap_dominant_aspiration$ (Domination Tree): -20% Crime, +5 Stability, +1% Specialist Output, +2% Worker Output\n- $lrsk_adv_civ_ap_expansionist_aspiration$ (Expansion Tree): +20% Survey Speed, -15% Starbase Influence Cost, +15% Colony Development Speed\n- $lrsk_adv_civ_ap_harmonious_aspiration$ (Harmony Tree): +5% Pop Happiness, +15% Pop Growth, -15% Empire sprawl from Pops\n- $lrsk_adv_civ_ap_acquisitive_aspiration$ (Prosperity Tree): +20% Trade Value, -10% Market Fee, +5% Energy production\n- $lrsk_adv_civ_ap_supremacist_aspiration$ (Supremacy Tree): +15% to Army Health, Damage, and Morale; +10% to Ship Fire Rate and Evasion\n\nRegardless of which you take, it will give you the following benefits:\n$lrsk_adv_civ_ap_aspiration_unlocks$"
