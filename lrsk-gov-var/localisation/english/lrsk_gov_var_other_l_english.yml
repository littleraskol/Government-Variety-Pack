Many European nations created companies like this in the early age of exploration and colonization. These nations did not actually have the funds to finance colonial ventures nor the administrative capacity to govern distant lands, so they created these companies as a form of indirect control over extraction: by selling stock in the company, they could raise the initial money (with the promise of a return to the initial investors) while also taxing all the trade between the colonies they created and the mother country.\n\nSince early game Stellaris is set in a new 'age of exploration and colonization,' this seemed like a good fit for a civic with its own playstyle. It puts you in the role of a mixed private/public entity called a §Y$lrsk_gov_var_gov_colonial_charter_board$§!, a kind of public holding corporation that 'charters' colonial companies. The way this works is: when you obtain a vassal, you should eventually be given a choice to turn them into a §Y$SUBJECT_lrsk_gov_var_subject_chartered_company$§! vassal. These pay you §G10%§! of their monthly £energy£ Energy and £minerals£ Minerals in taxes. You also get §G+2%§! £trade_value£ Trade Value and §G-1%§! Market Fee discount for each $SUBJECT_lrsk_gov_var_subject_chartered_company$ under your control.

 LRSK_QCC_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Your message has reached all [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Expect hostility."

 LRSK_QCC_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Formalities do not change the wave of hatred rolling over our mind as you speak."
 LRSK_QCC_INTEGRATE_FRIENDLY:0 "Although we value the [Root.GetName], there can hardly be a more worthy successor to us than the [From.GetName]."
 LRSK_QCC_INTEGRATE_NEUTRAL:0 "A radical suggestion, but we know the benefits of joining many into one."
 LRSK_QCC_INTEGRATE_HOSTILE:0 "We know the true meaning of unification. It is nothing like what you are suggesting."

 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "Our mental network is vast, giving us access to thoughts and ideas from every corner of our empire, but not a single entity has ever seen anything that would lend merit to your tragic existence."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "We have evaluated [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] as a candidate for joining the [From.GetName]. Sadly, we must inform you that membership requires a rudimentary brain."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Every [Root.GetSpeciesName] has heard your foul words, [From.GetSpeciesName], and we are not amused."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We wish we could forget such hard words, but as long as one [Root.GetSpeciesName] lives, the memory of your cruelty will live on."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Do not mistake our great capacity for thought as a lack of emotion. Our rage is greater than you can imagine, and we will make you feel its full extent."
