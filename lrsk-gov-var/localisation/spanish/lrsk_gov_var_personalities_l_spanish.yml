 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "Our mental network is vast, giving us access to thoughts and ideas from every corner of our empire, but not a single entity has ever seen anything that would lend merit to your tragic existence."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "We have evaluated [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] as a candidate for joining the [From.GetName]. Sadly, we must inform you that membership requires a rudimentary brain."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Every [Root.GetSpeciesName] has heard your foul words, [From.GetSpeciesName], and we are not amused."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "We wish we could forget such hard words, but as long as one [Root.GetSpeciesName] lives, the memory of your cruelty will live on."
 LRSK_QCC_INSULT_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Do not mistake our great capacity for thought as a lack of emotion. Our rage is greater than you can imagine, and we will make you feel its full extent."
